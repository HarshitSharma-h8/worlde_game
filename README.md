# WORDLE GAME 

## Overview  
React Wordle is a clone of the popular word game Wordle. Players attempt to guess a five-letter word within six tries. After each guess, the letters change color to indicate how close the guess was to the correct word: green for correct letters in the correct position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and gray for incorrect letters.
